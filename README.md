### Project Phase One
### Overview
As part of the companyâ€™s strategic initiative to diversify its portfolio, we are exploring opportunities in the aviation industry by purchasing and operating aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. This venture demands a thorough understanding of the potential risks associated with different aircraft models to ensure informed decision-making while minimizing operational, financial, and safety liabilities.
To support this endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of aviation safety data, focusing on identifying aircraft with the lowest risk profiles.
