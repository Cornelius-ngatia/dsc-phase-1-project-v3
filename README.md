## Project for phase one

### OVERVIEW

-As part of the companyâ€™s strategic initiative to diversify its portfolio, we are exploring opportunities in the aviation industry by purchasing and operating aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. This venture requires a thorough understanding of the potential risks associated with different aircraft models to ensure informed decision-making and minimize operational, financial, and safety liabilities.

-To support this endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of aviation safety data, focusing on identifying aircraft with the lowest risk profiles. By evaluating factors such as accident frequency, severity, and operational reliability, we aim to provide actionable insights that will guide the selection of aircraft models best suited for this new business venture.

-Our findings will help the aviation division make data-driven decisions, balancing safety, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These insights will serve as a foundation for building a competitive advantage in the aviation market while ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.
